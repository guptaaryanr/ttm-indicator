# ttm-indicator

uploading v1 of code i wrote a while back that gathers datasets of stocks and analyzes for momentum change (squeeze)

v1 does not provide chart viewing and momentum direction (which seems like a dumb thing to leave out) so these features will be added in v2

eventually a v3 combining multiple indicators or developing my own to increase success rate from 60% to at least 85% and automating all manual checking work
